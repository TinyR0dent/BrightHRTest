The frontend application is in "./frontend"

in "./frontend" create a .env file and add copy and paste this prop into it:

`VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`

run `pnpm i` to install packages

in a seperate terminal in the top level "./Front-End-Tech-Tasks" run `npm run dev`

run `pnpm dev` to start the frontend

I didn't have time to properly implement the sorting functionality, and with more time I would like to have the search functionality find files inside folders, as well as displaying all files found, rather than just the closest one.
